**************************
JavaScript Variables
**************************

* There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable: 
        * using var
        * using let
        * using const
* Variables are containers for storing data(values).


*************************
JavaScript Identifiers
*************************

* All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
* These unique names are called Identifiers.
* Identifiers can be short names(like x and y) or more descriptive names(age, num, totalVolumen). 
* The general rules for constructing names for variables(unique identfiers) are :
        * Names can contain letters, digits , underscores and dollar signs.
        * Names must begin with a letter.
        * Names can also begin with $ and '_'(but we will not use it in this tutorial)
        * Names are case sensitive(y and Y are different variables)
        * Reserved words(like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
* JavaScript identfiers are case-sensitive.


******************************
Assignment Operator
******************************

* In JavaScript, the equal sign(=) is an 'Assignment' Operator, not an 'equal to' operator. 
* The 'equal to' operator is written like == in JavaScript.


*****************************
JavaScript Data Types
*****************************

* JavaScript variables can hold like 100 and text values like 'John Doe'. 
* Text values are called text strings. 
* JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, jsut think of numbers and strings. 
* Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
* If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string. 


*****************************
Value = undefined
*****************************

* Variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.
* A variable declared without a value will have the value 'undefined'. 


******************************
Re_declaring Variables
******************************

* If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value. 


*******************************
JavaScript Arithmetic
*******************************

* We can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like '=' and '+' 
* We can also add string, but strings will be concatenated. 
* If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated. 

******************************
JavaScript Dollar Sign $
******************************

* Remember that JavaScript identfiers must begin with,
        * A letter(A-Z or a-z)
        * A dollar sign($)
        * Or an underscore(_)
* JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identfiers containing $ are valid variable names.
* Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.
* In the JavaScript library JQuery, for instance, the main function '$' is used to select HTML elements. In JQuery $("p"); means 'select all p elements'. 


*****************************
JavaScript underscore (_)
*****************************

* JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identfiers containing '_' are valid variable names. 
* Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers is to use it as an alias for "private(hidden)" variables.
