JavaScript Objects
*******************************

* A car has 'properties' like weight and color and 'methods' like start and stop
* All car have the same 'properties', but the property values differ from car  to car 
* All car have the same 'methods' , but the methods are performed at different times 
* We have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values. Objects are variables too . But objects can contain many values 
* The values are written as name:value pairs(name and value separated by a colon)
* It is a common practice to declare objects with the 'const' keyword
